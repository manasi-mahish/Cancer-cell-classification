# Cancer cell detection
In this notebook I have used deep learning model (based on pytorch) to classify malignant and benign cells. The model was created using fastai libraries.

The dataset is trained with resnet50. To improve accuracy, several techniques, such as, data augmentation, differential learning rate, progressive unfreezing and progressive resizing, etc have been applied. The overall accuracy achieved was 90%.
